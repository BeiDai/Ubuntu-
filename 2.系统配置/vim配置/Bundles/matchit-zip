t.vim script allows you to configure % to match more than just
single characters.  You can match words and even regular expressions.
Also, matching treats strings and comments (as recognized by the
syntax highlighting mechanism) intelligently.
The default ftplugins include settings for several languages:
Ada, ASP with VBS, Csh, DTD, Essbase, Fortran, HTML, JSP
(same as HTML), LaTeX, Lua, Pascal, SGML, Shell, Tcsh, Vim, XML.
(I no longer keep track, so there may be others.)
The documentation (included in the zip file) explains how to configure
the script for a new language and how to modify the defaults.
